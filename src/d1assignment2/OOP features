a.) student name, student id, course registered, Marks Scored, standing (semester wise), residential status.
I think other than student name and marks scored everything else can be exposed.

b.) Only one method is sufficient to calulate the grade of different type of student. Even though the declaration of the method
	might be same but the implementation will be different.

c.) Student Id, Student Name, Marks Scored, Semester, Residential Status are the attributes of students so 
	I would create a getter and setter for each of these properties. Other than that I would create a pay fees method
	Therefore a total of 11 functions.
	
d.) Encapsulation, and Inheritence.
